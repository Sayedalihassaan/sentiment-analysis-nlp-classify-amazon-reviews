# Sentiment Analysis: Classifying Amazon Reviews

This project focuses on **sentiment analysis** of Amazon reviews, leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify reviews into positive or negative sentiments. 

The goal of the project is to preprocess the textual data, extract meaningful features, and apply machine learning models for accurate sentiment prediction.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features using methods like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training classification models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks for sentiment prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for this project.
- **Libraries**:
  - **NLTK**: For text preprocessing.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For feature extraction and machine learning.
  - **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
